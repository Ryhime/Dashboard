# Dashboard


## CI/CD

Implements CI/CD pipelines for both the backend and frontend components using the following:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Front End Unit Tests Through Jasmine</li>
  <li>Postman Tests for Backend Where Needed</li>
  <li>Github Actions pipeline for linting and unit tests in the frontend.</li>
</ul>

## Bakend

Built in Python using Flask no database is used for now to keep the project more simple. Postman tests are made in the repo but are not ran in the pipeline due to the backend mostly calling outside sources so too many mocks would be needed.
